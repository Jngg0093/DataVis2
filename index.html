                        <p> Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the <b>24th of February, 2022</b> marked the biggest attack
                            on a European country since World War 2.
                            Since then, Russia and Ukraine have been at war, leading to many civilian and military
                            casualties, and triggering Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War 2.
                            This event marked a further escalation in the ongoing Russo-Ukraine War since 2014.

                            particular country.
                            Within the past decade, countries in Africa and the Middle East have consistently spent the
                            highest proportion of their GDP on their military.
                            These countries include <b>Libya</b>, <b>Saudi Arabia</b>, and <b>Oman</b>.

                        <p>To fight against the Russian invasion in 2022, <b>Ukraine</b> recorded the <b>highest

                            <b>33.55%</b>.
                            No country has come close to this amount of military prioritising in the past decade.
                            Surprisingly, Russia's military spending as a proportion of GDP has hardly increased from
                            its previous years.
                            This is most likely a result of the massive disparity in country size, with Ukraine the
                            clear underdog in this war.

                            Whilst Russia is the overwhelmingly dominant force of the two, Ukraine are still managing to

                            spending budget to that of Russia's.
                            <b>Almost 65% of Ukraine's military spending</b> to fight against Russia came from

                            benefactors, starting with the largest provided aid, being the

                            respectively.

                        <p>
                            The United States were the most generous benefactors by a large margin, giving <b>over $56
                                billion more</b> than the next highest donor, Germany.
                            They also provided the <b>most military and financial commitments</b> for Ukraine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, most of the aid Ukraine received were from military commitments, either
                            through funding or physical donations or support of military personnel, weaponary, or
                            vehicles.
                        </p>
                        <p> Even more, received assistance was not limited to NATO countries, with several non-NATO
                            showing their support as well countries.
                            Saying this, most of the aid received by Ukraine did indeed come from NATO countries, with
                            over <b>92% of foreign aid coming from NATO countries</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Given the military nature of the NATO alliance, it is unsurprising to see that most of its aid provided to Ukraine came in the form of military commitments.
                            This contrasts non-NATO countries, who focused more on providing financial commitments.
